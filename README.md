# Abstract
This paper examines the Masterless Starglitter System in Genshin
Impact (miHoYo, 2020) from the perspective of a player reinvesting
their Wish-earned Glitter into new Wishes. The goal is to calculate
the total number of Wishes a player can make starting with a certain
amount of Primogems/Wishes.
To simplify the calculations for players, certain assumptions are made.
Through a systematic mathematical analysis, we derive a general formula.
